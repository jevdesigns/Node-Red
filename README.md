# Alexa & Node-Red - How to control your Lights 


* Executive Summary: 
    * We are going to link Alexa with Node-Red by installing the right skill into the Alexa App and the right nodes into the Node-Red. 
    * We will install Node-Red using Docker ( you have to have Docker client installed). 
    * Then we will create a Node-Red flow that will have a device with the unique name in our case Kitchen Lights.  
    * And finally we will politely ask Alexa to turn the newly created device on and off
